### **Introduction to Evaa & Liquidation Bots**

**Evaa Protocol**:
> At the heart of decentralized finance (DeFi), Evaa stands as a pioneering protocol promoting the secure lending and borrowing of digital assets. It's the robust foundation that fortifies the trust and integrity of financial transactions in the DeFi space through stringent collateralization measures. When the market takes a dip, Evaa's proactive mechanisms come into play, ensuring stability and security.

**Liquidation Bots**:
> In the unpredictable landscape of DeFi, liquidation bots are the sentinels that guard against market volatility. These automated systems tirelessly surveil the market, pinpointing and acting upon vulnerable positions. By swiftly initiating liquidations, they play a crucial role in maintaining the equilibrium and reliability of platforms like Evaa.

1. Constantly monitors user positions in real time.
2. Triggers liquidation for positions exceeding the 107% threshold.
3. Seamlessly executes asset swaps on designated DEXs.

DEX Incentives:
- DEX DuDust: Bounty for platform usage.
- DEX StonFi: Bounty for platform usage.

API Incentives:
- TON ACCESS: Bounty for platform usage.

Free credits:
- TON API: 100 TON in API Credits for platform usage.

Your bot should smartly navigate these DEXs and make strategic decisions for optimal liquidation.

### **Understanding the EVAA Protocol Liquidation TX**

#### TON Loan Asset

If the loan asset is TON (TON Crystal), the following steps are performed:

1. Set the liquidation opcode to `0x3`.
2. Store the query ID, which can be `0`.
3. Store the user's wallet address (not the user SC address). This address is used to calculate the user SC address.
4. Store the ID of the token to be received. It's a SHA256 HASH derived from the Jetton wallet address of the EVAA master smart contract.
5. Store the minimal amount of tokens required to satisfy the liquidation.
6. Set a constant value of `-1` (can always be `-1`).
7. Reference the `pricesCell`, which contains prices obtainable from the IOTA NFT.
8. Conclude the cell.

Amount to send: `task.liquidationAmount`, minus `0.33` for blockchain fees. The EVAA smart contract will calculate the amount of collateral tokens to send back based on this number.

Destination address: `evaaMaster`.

---

#### Other Loan Assets

For loan assets other than TON, the following steps are performed:

1. Set the jetton transfer opcode to `0xf8a7ea5`.
2. Store the query ID, which can be `0`.
3. Store the amount of jettons to send (The EVAA smart contract will calculate the amount of collateral tokens to send back based on this number).
4. Store the address of the jetton receiver smart contract, which is the EVAA master.
5. Store the address of the contract to receive leftover TONs.
6. Set a bit to `0`.
7. Store the TON amount to forward in a token notification (Note: Clarification needed).
8. Set another bit to `1`.
9. Reference a sub-cell, which replicates the TON liquidation logic.
10. Conclude the main cell.

Amount to send: `toNano('1')` for transaction chain fees (Note: Clarification needed).

Destination address: The Jetton wallet associated with the loan asset.

This code provides a clear explanation of the liquidation process, with detailed comments to understand each step.

### Network Fee Calculation for Lending Master Contract Operations

In order to determine the amount of TONs needed for network fees (with some excess, where the unused portion is refunded), you should call the corresponding get-method on the Lending Master contract:

- `int supply_min_attachment(int fwd_fee) method_id`
- `int withdraw_min_attachment(int fwd_fee, cell withdraw_user_message) method_id`
- `int liquidate_min_attachment(int fwd_fee) method_id`

All these methods accept `"fwd_fee"` as the first parameter. This should be taken from one of the recent Supply/Withdraw/Liquidate requests (corresponding to the method being called) from TON/Jetton wallet to the Lending Master. Note that `"request"` refers to the first message that enters the lending protocol and initiates the corresponding operation. Keep in mind that `"fwd_fee"` might vary when sending TONs and Jettons.

The `withdraw_min_attachment` get-method also requires `"withdraw_user_message"` as the second parameter. To determine if the attached TONs are sufficient for proceeding with a Withdraw request, the Master contract uses a real assembled message about to be sent to the Lending-User contract. For convenience, you can obtain a sample `"withdraw_user_message"` to be used for determining the amount to attach by calling:
- `cell dummy_withdraw_user_message() method_id`
on the Lending Master contract.

Remember, you can always attach more than required; any excess attachment will be refunded.
